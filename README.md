# Arduino Hobby Projects

This repository contains a collection of Arduino projects I created for learning and fun. Each project is organized into its own folder with a descriptive name. All projects have been simulated using Tinkercad, allowing for easy visualization and testing of the circuits before implementation on physical hardware.

## Projects

### [Motion Alert](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eMnQJ5scCdp-motion-alert?sharecode=1SYWGJN_wL03heTS6QF4G6_G7YrBKiHRXbuQ_gsJWAE)

This project builds a motion detection mechanism that triggers a police-like alert sound when movement is detected using sensors. The simulation in Tinkercad demonstrates how the sensor detects motion and activates the alert system.

### [Reverse Gear Sensor](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/6F6WmQxWOYg-reverse-gear-sensor?sharecode=UJ_Z7EJ-NfTez2HSH69hQbYX2JHqsPPrxIVfBO7o-g8)

This project simulates the reverse gear sensor of cars using an ultrasound sensor. It provides visual feedback when the car is in reverse gear. The Tinkercad simulation showcases how the ultrasound sensor detects obstacles and signals the reverse status.

### [RGB LED](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/iGM1CaRDt4o-rgb-led?sharecode=WKI6L-sd5uDz8B-9uwmE7gXV_15mbjMR-o9gIjDLp8Q)

A simple project that demonstrates how to control an RGB LED to change colors. The Tinkercad simulation allows you to see how different color combinations can be achieved through code and circuit design.

### [Traffic Light](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/2rbG0GkJsT1-traffic-light?sharecode=HMQWEww0c4ylC0U-EYOQa7zacmYDgyBh2pA2EO-01oE)

This project simulates the operation of a traffic light using three RGB LEDs to represent the red, yellow, and green lights. It cycles through the different light patterns to mimic a real traffic light. The simulation in Tinkercad effectively illustrates the timing and sequencing of the traffic light operation.

### [IR-Repeat-O-Matic](https://github.com/dmaon/IR-Repeat-O-Matic)

Have you ever found yourself frustrated by a lost remote control or the need to juggle multiple remotes for your devices? Introducing the IR-Repeat-O-Matic, a fun and innovative project that allows you to copy and mimic the signals from any infrared remote control with just the press of a button!

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you will need:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Various electronic components (e.g., LEDs, resistors, sensors) depending on the specific project

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the Arduino IDE** and navigate to the folder of the project you want to work on.
3. **Upload the code** to your Arduino board.
4. **Connect the necessary components** to your Arduino board according to the project's wiring diagram.
5. **Enjoy** your Arduino project!

## Tinkercad Simulations

For each project, I have provided Tinkercad simulation links (if available) that allow you to interact with the circuits virtually. This is a great way to test and understand the functionality of each project before building it physically.

## Contributing

If you have any improvements or additional projects you'd like to add, feel free to submit a pull request. I welcome contributions from the community to enhance these projects further.
